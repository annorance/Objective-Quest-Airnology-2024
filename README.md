# Objective-Quest-Airnology-2024
## Description
In today‚Äôs digital era, cybersecurity has become one of the top priorities for companies managing high-traffic websites. As the number of users and connected devices increases, along with the growing complexity of cyberattacks, the need to monitor and protect networks becomes even more crucial. Every day, large companies must handle various types of traffic flowing in and out of their servers‚Äîfrom legitimate user activity to potential threats such as attacks and other malicious behavior.

To maintain network integrity and security, cybersecurity teams must effectively identify and classify the types of traffic within the network. However, with massive data volumes and high variability in traffic patterns, a system capable of real-time detection and analysis of suspicious activity is required. Building an effective model will enable companies to proactively detect and respond to potential threats.

## Task
Participants are expected to build and develop a predictive model that can classify network traffic types. This model must be able to analyze large and diverse traffic data, identify suspicious patterns, and accurately predict the traffic category.

Jenis-jenis Traffic yang Harus Diprediksi:
- Background ‚Äì Routine or background traffic that typically does not pose a threat.
- Benign ‚Äì Traffic that shows no signs of harmful or anomalous activity.
- Probing ‚Äì Scanning or probing activity to identify vulnerabilities or targets.
- Bruteforce ‚Äì Attack attempts using various password combinations to gain access.
- XMRIGCC CryptoMiner ‚Äì Activities related to covert cryptocurrency mining.
- Bruteforce-XML ‚Äì Brute force attacks targeting XML-based applications.

## Evaluation Metric
In this competition, model performance will be evaluated using the average of the Balanced Accuracy Score and Accuracy Score.
```
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, balanced_accuracy_score

bal_acc = balanced_accuracy_score(solution, submission)
acc = accuracy_score(solution, submission)
score = (bal_acc+acc)/2
```
The final score (100%) is based on the leaderboard, which reflects the accuracy consistency between the organizer‚Äôs notebook validation and the participant‚Äôs Kaggle submission. The final score will be calculated using a weighted average:
```
nilai akhir = 30% public + 70% private
```

## Result and Discussion
To address class imbalance in the dataset, the BorderlineSMOTE technique was applied‚Äîan oversampling method that focuses on generating synthetic data near decision boundaries between classes. The model used was Multilayer Perceptron Classifier (MLPClassifier) with a three-hidden-layer architecture containing 150, 100, and 50 neurons respectively. The model was configured with the ReLU activation function, optimized using Adam, and used a ridge penalty (alpha) of 0.01. The batch size was set to 400, initial learning rate to 0.001, maximum iterations to 5000, and convergence tolerance to 1e-6 for more stable optimization.

Evaluation results showed strong performance, with a public score of 0.73250 and a private score of 0.73547. The relatively small difference between public and private scores indicates good generalization ability of the model on unseen data. Additionally, the use of BorderlineSMOTE proved effective in improving model performance on the imbalanced dataset.
